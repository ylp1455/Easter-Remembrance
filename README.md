# Easter Remembrance

## Introduction
"Easter Remembrance" is a poignant tribute to the enduring power of memory and love. In the journey of life, we often find ourselves carrying the weight of absence, especially during significant moments of remembrance. This project seeks to create a digital space where individuals can reflect, remember, and find solace together, especially during the Easter season.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for reflection and connection, allowing visitors to contemplate the passage of time and the enduring nature of love and remembrance. Through the simple yet profound interface, users can engage in moments of quiet contemplation, offering prayers and thoughts for those they hold dear.

## Features
- **Real-time Countdown**: Experience the passage of time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years, symbolizing the journey we all undertake.
- **Prayer Together**: Engage in collective prayer and reflection, symbolized by the "Pray Together" feature, reminding us of the power of unity and shared intention.
